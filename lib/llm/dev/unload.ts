/**
 * Dev-only helpers. Anything in this module exists for local benchmarking
 * convenience and is intentionally **not** re-exported from the main SDK

 * `@catalyst/llm-sdk/dev` won't pull this code into their bundle.
 *
 * Why dev-only: the unload trick relies on `keep_alive: 0` being honored by
 * the upstream backend (Ollama via LiteLLM). It's safe to send anywhere, but
 * it's a benchmarking concern, not an end-user concern, and we don't want
 * production chat surfaces to ship code that "evicts the model" by design.

 * it to Ollama, which immediately evicts the model. Cloud providers ignore
 * the field. Errors are swallowed — this is purely a memory-pressure hint.
