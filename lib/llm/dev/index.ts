// Dev-only barrel. Importing from `@catalyst/llm-sdk/dev` is opt-in and
// is intentionally not re-exported from the main `@catalyst/llm-sdk`
// entry — production bundles that don't reach for `/dev` ship none of
// this code.
//
// Heavy modules below (DuckDB-WASM ~10 MB) are also lazy-`import()`d
// internally so the wasm bundle is fetched on first use, not on the
// initial `import "@/catalyst-ui/llm/dev"` itself.
