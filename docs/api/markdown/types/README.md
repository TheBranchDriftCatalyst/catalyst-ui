# markdown/types

## Description

Type definitions for the markdown parsing and rendering system.

This module re-exports mdast types and defines custom types for markdown
processing utilities. It provides TypeScript type safety for the entire
markdown â†’ React transformation pipeline.

**Type categories:**

- **mdast types** - Standard markdown AST node types (re-exported from mdast)
- **Extraction types** - Structured data extracted from markdown (sections, tables, code blocks)
- **Metadata types** - Repository and project metadata (for catalyst_repo.yaml)

## Examples

```ts
import type { Root, Heading, Paragraph } from "@/catalyst-ui/utils/markdown/types";

function processHeading(heading: Heading) {
  console.log(heading.depth); // 1-6
  console.log(heading.children); // Array of inline nodes
}
```

```ts
import type { MarkdownSection, ExtractedCodeBlock } from '@/catalyst-ui/utils/markdown/types';

const section: MarkdownSection = {
  heading: "Installation",
  level: 2,
  content: [/* mdast nodes
