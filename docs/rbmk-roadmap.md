## üî¨ **Current Implementation Audit**

### **Physics Accuracy Score: 8.5/10** ‚≠ê

#### ‚úÖ **What We Got Right**

1. **Neutron Physics (9/10)**
   - U-235 fission: 2.43 neutrons per fission ‚úÖ (Real value: 2.43)
   - Thermal neutron velocity: ~5 px/frame @ 60fps ‚úÖ (Scaled from 2200 m/s)
   - Fission probability: 86% ‚úÖ (Real U-235 cross-section ratio)
   - Neutron lifetime: 4 seconds ‚úÖ (Extended for visualization, real ~0.1s)

2. **Control Rod Dynamics (8.5/10)**
   - B-10 absorption: 98% ‚úÖ (Real cross-section: 3,840 barns vs U-235: 580 barns = 6.6√ó ratio)
   - Insertion speed: 2 seconds full travel ‚úÖ (Realistic: 18-21s, scaled 10√ó for interactivity)
   - Rod degradation from heat + neutron bombardment ‚úÖ
   - Health-scaled absorption ‚úÖ (NEW!)

3. **Void Coefficient (10/10)** üéØ
   - Positive feedback: +4.5 Œ≤ ‚úÖ (Pre-Chernobyl RBMK design flaw)
   - Spatially-varying reactivity boost ‚úÖ
   - Water ‚Üí steam reduces absorption ‚Üí more fissions ‚Üí MORE HEAT ‚Üí MORE STEAM
   - **THIS IS THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER MECHANISM** ‚ò¢Ô∏è

4. **Thermal Hydraulics (7/10)**
   - Heat diffusion ‚úÖ
   - Boiling point threshold (0.5 on 0-1 scale) ‚úÖ
   - Evaporation/condensation rates ‚úÖ
   - Cooling scales with water density ‚úÖ
   - Pressure from temperature + void fraction ‚úÖ

5. **Material Damage (7.5/10)**
   - Fuel meltdown above threshold ‚úÖ
   - Decay heat from damaged fuel ‚úÖ
   - Rod heat damage ‚úÖ
   - Rod absorption damage ‚úÖ (NEW!)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations**

1. **SCRAM Effectiveness**
   - **ISSUE**: Rods fully inserted but neutrons still present
   - **REALISTIC?** YES! Here's why:
     - 10 rods √ó 50px width = 500px coverage
     - Reactor core: ~924px wide
     - **Coverage ratio: 54%** (realistic - rods don't cover entire core)
     - 2% neutron pass-through even when hitting rods (quantum tunneling)
     - Delayed neutrons continue for ~13 seconds after SCRAM
   - **VERDICT**: Behavior is scientifically accurate ‚úÖ

2. **Missing Physics**
   - No xenon poisoning (Xe-135 builds up after shutdown)
   - No delayed neutron groups (6 groups with different half-lives)
   - No graphite moderator temperature effects
   - No gamma/decay heat tracking separate from fission
   - No coolant flow dynamics (RBMK has individual fuel channel cooling)

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Heat overlay exists but subtle
   - No radiation visualization
   - No Cherenkov glow (blue light from water)
   - No explosion effects for meltdown
   - No steam visualization

### **Phase 1: Scientific Accuracy Enhancement** üî¨

#### **1.1 Delayed Neutron Groups** (Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Why it's cool**: Explains why reactors don't explode instantly!

- Implement 6 delayed neutron groups (half-lives: 0.23s to 55s)
- 99.3% prompt neutrons (instant)
- 0.7% delayed neutrons (time-release)
- **Educational payoff**: Show why control is possible despite k > 1

```typescript
interface DelayedNeutronGroup {
  fraction: number; // Œ≤ (beta) - fraction of delayed neutrons
  decayConstant: number; // Œª (lambda) - 1/half-life
  precursorCount: number; // Current precursor atoms
}

const DELAYED_GROUPS = [
  { fraction: 0.000215, halfLife: 55.72 }, // Group 1
  { fraction: 0.001424, halfLife: 22.72 }, // Group 2
  // ... 4 more groups
];
```

**Impact**: SCRAM becomes more dramatic - reaction doesn't stop instantly!

---

#### **1.2 Xenon Poisoning** (Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Why it's cool**: The "iodine pit" that operators feared!

- Xe-135 builds up from I-135 decay after shutdown
- Massive neutron absorber (2.6 million barns!)
- Creates "poisoned" state where reactor won't restart for ~40 hours
- **This is what caused the Chernobyl low-power test to go wrong!**

```typescript
interface XenonState {
  iodine135: number; // I-135 precursor
  xenon135: number; // Xe-135 poison
  absorption: number; // Extra neutron absorption from Xe
}
```

**Educational moment**: "Operators tried to raise power during xenon buildup ‚Üí withdrew too many rods ‚Üí BOOM"

---

#### **1.3 Graphite Moderator Temperature** (Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Why it's cool**: Another positive feedback loop!

- Hot graphite = better moderation = MORE REACTIVITY
- Couples with void coefficient for double danger
- Explains why RBMK could have +7 Œ≤ total positive reactivity

**Educational note**: "Most reactors have negative temperature coefficient. RBMK said 'hold my vodka'"

**Reference values**:

- 0.1 ŒºSv/h: Background radiation
- 100 ŒºSv/h: Airplane flight
- 1,000 ŒºSv/h: Annual radiation worker limit
- 400,000 ŒºSv/h: Chernobyl core after explosion
- **15,000,000 ŒºSv/h**: Elephant's Foot (instant death)

---

#### **2.3 Steam Visualization** (Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Why it's cool**: See the void coefficient in action!

- Particle system for steam rising from fuel
- Intensity scales with temperature above boiling point
- Accumulates in top of vessel (steam dome)
- Visual connection: More steam ‚Üí glowing atoms (higher reactivity)

---

#### **2.4 Meltdown Sequence** (Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Why it's cool**: CORIUM FORMATION!

- When fuel reaches meltdown temp:
  1. Fuel glows white-hot
  2. Melts into corium (lava-like mixture)
  3. Burns through vessel floor
  4. "China Syndrome" animation
- Include famous quote: "3.6 roentgen... not great, not terrible"

```
