# Archive

This directory contains historical documentation for completed features and initiatives.

## Purpose

When features, initiatives, or major refactoring efforts are completed, their tracking documents are moved here for reference. This keeps the active `docs/features/` directory focused on current and planned work.

## Structure

- **`completed/`** - Fully implemented features and completed initiatives
  - Documents here represent work that has been finished and released
  - These documents are kept for historical reference and learning
  - Example: Completed phases of refactoring efforts, finished feature implementations

## When to Archive

Move documents here when:

- ✅ All checklist items are complete
- ✅ Work is released in a stable version
- ✅ No further development is actively planned
- ✅ Document serves primarily as historical reference

Documents that are partially complete or have planned future work should remain in `docs/features/`.

## Referencing Archived Documents

When updating active documents, reference archived work:

```markdown
See [Completed Feature Name](../archive/completed/feature-name.md) for implementation history.
```
