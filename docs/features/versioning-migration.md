# Migrate from standard-version to Modern Release Automation

## Overview

Migrate from the deprecated `standard-version` package to a modern, actively maintained release automation tool. standard-version has been deprecated since 2022 and receives no updates, posing risks for future Node.js compatibility and security vulnerabilities.

### Vision

**Automated, reliable versioning and changelog generation** that works seamlessly across the catalyst-devspace monorepo while supporting individual package releases. The ideal solution should:

- Generate accurate changelogs from conventional commits
- Support both monorepo and standalone package workflows
- Integrate with existing GitHub workflows
- Provide flexibility for manual version overrides when needed
- Be actively maintained with a healthy community

### Key Differentiators

1. **Monorepo-First Design**: Unlike standard-version, modern tools like Changesets natively support monorepo workflows with independent versioning
2. **Active Maintenance**: Choosing tools with strong community backing ensures long-term compatibility and security
3. **GitHub-Native Integration**: Modern solutions integrate directly with GitHub PRs and releases for better visibility
4. **Backward Compatible**: Migration path preserves existing conventional commit workflow and CHANGELOG.md format

## Current State

### Existing Infrastructure We Can Leverage

‚úÖ **Conventional Commits** (`package.json` - commitlint config)

- Already enforcing conventional commit messages via commitlint
- Team familiar with `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` prefixes
- Foundation for automated versioning

‚úÖ **Husky Git Hooks** (`package.json` - husky, lint-staged)

- Pre-commit hooks already configured
- Can be extended for release workflow validation
- Ensures commit quality before releases

‚úÖ **CHANGELOG.md Format** (`public/CHANGELOG.md`)

- Existing changelog copied to public directory during build
- Users expect this format
- New tool must maintain compatibility

‚úÖ **NPM Scripts Structure** (`package.json` - release scripts)

- `release:first`, `release:patch`, `release:minor`, `release:major`
- Team familiar with this workflow
- New tool should provide similar DX

### What's Missing

‚ùå Active maintenance (standard-version deprecated since 2022)
‚ùå Monorepo support for coordinated releases across workspace
‚ùå GitHub PR integration for release previews
‚ùå Automated dependency bumping between workspace packages
‚ùå Visual release notes in GitHub Releases UI

## Problem Statement

### Current Behavior

- ‚úÖ **What Works**: standard-version generates changelogs and bumps versions based on conventional commits
- ‚úÖ **What Works**: NPM scripts provide clear release workflow
- ‚úÖ **What Works**: Conventional commits enforced via commitlint
- ‚ùå **What Doesn't**: No updates since 2022, potential security/compatibility issues
- ‚ùå **What Doesn't**: No monorepo support for workspace-level coordination
- ‚ùå **What Doesn't**: Limited GitHub integration (no PR previews, manual release creation)
- ‚ùå **What Doesn't**: Cannot coordinate versions between catalyst-ui and other workspace packages

### Risk Assessment

**High Priority Risks:**

- **Security**: No patches for vulnerabilities discovered after 2022
- **Compatibility**: May break with Node.js 23+, future npm versions
- **Maintenance**: No bug fixes or feature updates

**Medium Priority Risks:**

- **Monorepo Growth**: As workspace adds packages, coordination becomes critical
- **Team Onboarding**: New developers may expect modern tooling (GitHub releases, PR automation)

## Alternative Tools Comparison

### Data Flow

**Step 1: Developer adds changeset**

```bash
$ yarn changeset
ü¶ã  Which packages would you like to include?
‚óâ catalyst-ui

ü¶ã  What kind of change is this?
‚ùØ patch (0.0.X)
  minor (0.X.0)
  major (X.0.0)

ü¶ã  Please enter a summary for this change:
fix: resolve jerky dragging in ForceGraph after memoization

‚úÖ Changeset added: .changeset/fuzzy-pandas-dance.md
```

**Generated changeset file:**

```markdown
---
"catalyst-ui": patch
---

fix: resolve jerky dragging in ForceGraph after memoization
```

**Step 2: Changesets bot comments on PR**

```
ü¶ã Changeset detected

This PR includes a changeset:
- catalyst-ui: patch (bug fix)

Summary: fix: resolve jerky dragging in ForceGraph after memoization
```

**Step 3: After merge, Version PR created**

```
Title: Version Packages

Changed packages:
- catalyst-ui: 1.2.1 ‚Üí 1.2.2

CHANGELOG updates:
## 1.2.2
### Patch Changes
- fix: resolve jerky dragging in ForceGraph after memoization
```

**Step 4: Merge Version PR ‚Üí Auto-release**

```
‚úÖ Published catalyst-ui@1.2.2 to npm
‚úÖ Created GitHub Release v1.2.2
‚úÖ Updated CHANGELOG.md
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (Low Risk)

#### Step 1: Install Changesets

**File**: `package.json`

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@changesets/cli": "^2.27.1",
    "@changesets/changelog-github": "^0.5.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "changeset": "changeset",
    "changeset:version": "changeset version",
    "changeset:publish": "changeset publish",
    "changeset:status": "changeset status"
  }
}
```

**Purpose**: Add changesets CLI without removing standard-version (safe coexistence)

#### Step 2: Initialize Changesets

**Command**:

```bash
yarn changeset init
```

**Generated**: `.changeset/config.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config@3.0.0/schema.json",
  "changelog": ["@changesets/changelog-github", { "repo": "TheBranchDriftCatalyst/catalyst-ui" }],
  "commit": false,
  "fixed": [],
  "linked": [],
  "access": "public",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "updateInternalDependencies": "patch",
  "ignore": []
}
```

**Purpose**: Configure changesets for catalyst-ui with GitHub changelog

#### Step 3: Document New Workflow

**File**: `docs/development/workflow.md` (update)

```markdown
## Release Process

### Option 1: Changesets (Recommended)

1. Make your changes
2. Run `yarn changeset` and describe the change
3. Commit both code and `.changeset/*.md` file
4. Open PR - bot will comment with version preview
5. After merge, Version PR is auto-created
6. Review and merge Version PR ‚Üí auto-publishes

### Option 2: Manual (Legacy - standard-version)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated**: standard-version is unmaintained. Use changesets instead.

1. `yarn release:patch` / `release:minor` / `release:major`
2. Review CHANGELOG.md changes
3. Push tags manually
```

**Purpose**: Guide team through new workflow while preserving old docs

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration

#### Step 1: Run Both Tools in Parallel (2-4 weeks)

**Strategy**:

- Keep `standard-version` scripts for emergencies
- Encourage team to use `yarn changeset` for new work
- Monitor adoption, gather feedback

**Success Criteria**:

- 5+ PRs using changesets successfully
- Team comfortable with workflow
- No blockers identified

#### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Action

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Create Release Pull Request or Publish
        id: changesets
        uses: changesets/action@v1
        with:
          publish: yarn changeset:publish
          version: yarn changeset:version
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

**Purpose**: Automate version PR creation and publishing

#### Step 3: Update Commitlint Config (Optional Enhancement)

**File**: `commitlint.config.js` (if exists) or `package.json`

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
  rules: {
    "footer-max-line-length": [0, "always"], // Allow changeset references
    "body-max-line-length": [0, "always"],
  },
};
```

**Purpose**: Ensure commitlint doesn't conflict with changeset workflow

### Phase 3: Complete Migration

#### Step 1: Remove standard-version

**File**: `package.json`

```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "standard-version": "^9.5.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
-   "release:first": "standard-version --first-release",
-   "release:patch": "standard-version --release-as patch",
-   "release:minor": "standard-version --release-as minor",
-   "release:major": "standard-version --release-as major",
  }
}
```

**Purpose**: Clean up deprecated tooling

#### Step 2: Archive Migration Documentation

**File**: `docs/development/standard-version-migration.md`

```markdown
# standard-version ‚Üí Changesets Migration (Completed)

## What Changed

- Removed: standard-version (deprecated since 2022)
- Added: @changesets/cli for versioning and changelog

## Why We Migrated

[... migration rationale ...]

## Historical Context

For versions ‚â§ 1.2.1, standard-version was used.
From 1.2.2+, changesets manages releases.
```

**Purpose**: Preserve context for future maintainers

## Features

### Core Features ‚úÖ

- **Automated Versioning**: Bumps versions based on changeset severity (patch/minor/major)
- **Changelog Generation**: Creates GitHub-flavored CHANGELOG.md automatically
- **PR Integration**: Bot comments on PRs showing version impact
- **GitHub Releases**: Auto-creates releases with release notes
- **NPM Publishing**: Publishes to npm on version PR merge
- **Monorepo Support**: Can expand to cover workspace packages (catalyst-py, etc.)

### Advanced Features (Future)

- **Cross-package Dependencies**: Auto-bump dependent workspace packages
- **Release Candidates**: Support for beta/alpha releases via tags
- **Custom Changelog Sections**: Group changes by component/area
- **Slack Notifications**: Alert team when new versions publish
- **Release Scheduling**: Hold changes, batch releases weekly/monthly

## Rollback Plan

If migration encounters blockers:

### Quick Rollback (< 1 hour)

```bash
# 1. Remove changesets
yarn remove @changesets/cli @changesets/changelog-github

# 2. Restore standard-version scripts in package.json
git restore package.json

# 3. Delete changesets config
rm -rf .changeset

# 4. Continue using standard-version
yarn release:patch  # Works as before
```

### Hybrid Approach (Both Tools)

- Keep standard-version for hotfixes/urgent releases
- Use changesets for planned releases
- Gradually increase changesets adoption

## Migration Timeline

- [ ] Expand to other workspace packages (if beneficial) (not applicable)

## Expected Outcomes

### Developer Experience

**Before (standard-version):**

```bash
# Manual version selection
$ yarn release:minor
‚úî bumping version in package.json from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0
‚úî outputting changes to CHANGELOG.md
‚úî committing package.json and CHANGELOG.md
‚úî tagging release v1.3.0

# Manual push + GitHub release creation
$ git push --follow-tags origin main
$ gh release create v1.3.0 --notes "..." # Manual
```

**After (changesets):**

```bash
# Describe change during development
$ yarn changeset
ü¶ã Summary: feat: add D4Loader interactive controls

# PR opens ‚Üí bot comments automatically
# On merge ‚Üí Version PR created automatically
# Merge Version PR ‚Üí Publishes automatically
```

**Time Saved**: ~10 minutes per release (no manual GitHub release, tags, etc.)

### Changelog Quality

**Before**: Generic commit messages

```markdown
## 1.2.0

- feat: add new feature (#123)
- fix: bug fix (#124)
```

**After**: Descriptive summaries

```markdown
## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Added interactive controls to D4Loader with real-time animation adjustments
  Includes sliders for rotation speed, chromatic intensity, and spark frequency

### Patch Changes

- Resolved jerky dragging in ForceGraph by removing parent component memoization
```

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Actively Maintained**: Regular updates, security patches, Node.js compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Monorepo Ready**: Native support for multi-package versioning
- ‚úÖ **Better Visibility**: GitHub PR integration shows version impact before merge
- ‚úÖ **Safer Releases**: Review version bump in dedicated PR before publishing
- ‚úÖ **Time Savings**: Automated GitHub releases, no manual tag pushing
- ‚úÖ **Improved Changelogs**: Human-written summaries vs. raw commit messages
- ‚úÖ **Team Collaboration**: PR comments enable release planning discussions
- ‚úÖ **Future Proof**: Popular, well-supported tool with strong community

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Monorepo Expansion

- [ ] **catalyst-py Integration**: Add changesets for Python package versioning
- [ ] **Linked Versions**: Coordinate releases across TypeScript + Python packages
- [ ] **Workspace Dependencies**: Auto-bump when catalyst-ui updates catalyst-py integration

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation

- [ ] **Snapshot Releases**: Publish pre-release versions on feature branches
- [ ] **Release Scheduling**: Hold changes for weekly batch releases
- [ ] **Custom Changelog Sections**: Group by component (ForceGraph, Cards, Hooks, etc.)

### Developer Experience

- [ ] **Changeset Templates**: Pre-filled templates for common change types
- [ ] **Visual Studio Code Extension**: Inline changeset creation in IDE
- [ ] **Release Analytics**: Track release frequency, version bump patterns

## Dependencies

### Required

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@changesets/cli": "^2.27.1",
    "@changesets/changelog-github": "^0.5.0"
  }
}
```

### GitHub Requirements

- **Secrets**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatic), `NPM_TOKEN` (manual setup)
- **Permissions**: GitHub Actions enabled, write access to create PRs/releases
- **Branch Protection**: Optional - require Version PR reviews before publish

### Already Installed (Compatible)

- ‚úÖ `@commitlint/cli` - Works alongside changesets
- ‚úÖ `husky` - Can add `changeset status` to pre-commit hooks
- ‚úÖ `prettier` - Formats changeset markdown files

## Known Issues

### Changeset Files in Git History

- **Issue**: `.changeset/*.md` files add noise to git history
- **Mitigation**: Files are deleted automatically after version PR merge
- **Status**: Minor annoyance, acceptable trade-off for workflow benefits

### Learning Curve

- **Issue**: Team must learn new `yarn changeset` workflow
- **Mitigation**: 30-min training session + docs, keep standard-version as backup during transition
- **Status**: Low risk, similar to tools used at Vercel, Remix, etc.

### NPM Token Management

- **Issue**: Requires NPM_TOKEN secret in GitHub
- **Mitigation**: Use granular access token, scope to catalyst-ui package only
- **Status**: Standard practice, documented in GitHub Actions setup

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Parallel Operation

- [ ] Install changesets without breaking standard-version (not done)
- [ ] Run `yarn changeset` successfully creates `.changeset/*.md` (cannot test - not installed)
- [ ] Generated changeset file follows correct format (not applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated with new workflow (not done)
- [ ] Team can access and understand new commands (not applicable)

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration

- [ ] GitHub Action triggers on push to main (not configured)
- [ ] Version PR created automatically with correct version bump (not implemented)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updates match changeset descriptions (not applicable)
- [ ] Merging Version PR publishes to npm successfully (not implemented)
- [ ] GitHub Release created with correct tag and notes (not implemented)

### Phase 3: Production Readiness

- [ ] 5+ successful releases using changesets (not started)
- [ ] No regressions in release process (not applicable)
- [ ] Team confident with new workflow (not started)
- [ ] standard-version safely removed (NOT removed - still in use)
- [ ] Migration documentation archived (not applicable)

## Alternative Approaches

### Alternative 1: commit-and-tag-version (Quick Fix)

**Description**: Drop-in replacement for standard-version, same API and commands

**Pros:**

- Zero migration effort (1-line package.json change)
- Keeps existing workflow intact
- Actively maintained fork

**Cons:**

- Doesn't solve monorepo limitations
- Misses GitHub PR integration benefits
- Tactical fix, not strategic solution

**Decision**: ‚ùå Rejected - Delays inevitable migration, doesn't address monorepo needs

### Alternative 2: semantic-release (Full Automation)

**Description**: Fully automated versioning based on commit messages, no human intervention

**Pros:**

- Maximum automation (no changeset step)
- Most popular tool (2M downloads/week)
- Extensive plugin ecosystem

**Cons:**

- Poor monorepo support (plugins outdated)
- All-or-nothing automation (hard to override)
- Complex configuration
- Requires CI/CD (no local releases)

**Decision**: ‚ùå Rejected - Monorepo limitations are deal-breaker for catalyst-devspace

### Alternative 3: Release-Please (Google's Tool)

**Description**: GitHub Action that creates release PRs based on conventional commits

**Pros:**

- Fully automated like semantic-release
- Better monorepo support than semantic-release
- Google backing ensures maintenance

**Cons:**

- GitHub Actions only (no local workflow)
- Less control over version bumps
- Opinionated workflow

**Decision**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Deferred - Strong candidate, but changesets offers more flexibility for hybrid monorepo/standalone use

## Implementation Notes

### 2025-10-08 - Claude Code

**Context**: User identified standard-version as deprecated/unmaintained. Research confirms:

- Last update: 2022 (v9.5.0)
- Official deprecation notice in GitHub issues (#919)
- Recommended alternatives: release-please, commit-and-tag-version

**Decision Rationale**: Chose changesets over alternatives because:

1. **Monorepo focus**: catalyst-devspace is a monorepo - changesets designed for this
2. **Flexibility**: Works for both coordinated releases and independent package versions
3. **Adoption**: Used by Remix, Radix UI, and other React ecosystem projects
4. **Control**: Maintains manual override capability (important for major releases)

**Migration Strategy**: Gradual adoption minimizes risk:

- Week 1-2: Install alongside standard-version (safe)
- Week 3-4: Parallel operation (team learning)
- Week 5-6: Full cutover (remove old tool)

**Open Questions**:

- Do we want to expand to Python packages (catalyst-py)?
- Should releases be automated or require manual Version PR approval? (Recommend manual for control)
- Who manages NPM_TOKEN GitHub secret?
